## Adding your code
I am always taking suggestens for this project and any new cogs you would like to add, however to keep this project code clean please ensure to format your code using Flake8 to ensure the code base stays clean you are allowed to bypass some types of errors however `F722`, `F821`, and `E501` to fix some errors in Flake8. Please make sure when you bypass these errors you give a good reason however otherwise the change may be rejected. Thank you for keeping the code clean and manageable for everyone!
